    "The three models that can be appropriate for this task are: Random Forest (Ensemble Method), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussainNB). Given we are faced with a classification task using the dataset, the three models mentioned above are well suited for such classification tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest**: Random Forest classifier is a machine-learning algorithm falling under the category of ensemble learning, which takes the bagging (bootstrap aggergating) approach. Briefly, random forest, as the name suggests, consists of many (random) trees. Each tree is a classifier that is trained independently of other trees. As a classifier, the tree is developed by randomly selecting a subset of features and performing a split over a number of nodes. The result is the predictions provided by the leaf nodes of the tree. Random forest does this for multiple trees. The final predictions are obtained by averaging over the forest. One suggested real world application of Random Forest in machine fault diagnosis. See paper titled: [Application of Random Forest Algorithm in Machine Fault Diagnosis](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-84628-814-2_82#page-1). Advantages of Random Forests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highly robust classifier shown to give very accurate results.\n",
    "2. Capable of handling thousands of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training on large datasets can be slow.\n",
    "2. Can sometimes overfit the data especially if it is noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines**: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are class of supervised learning algorithms that have historically been used for classification purposes. The idea has been to come up with hyper-plane or set of hyper-planes that can separate the samples in two or more classes. They have been for text classification purposes. See paper titled: [Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with Many Relevant Features](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/joachims_98a.pdf). Advantages of using SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Well developed for binary classification task.\n",
    "2. Work well when we have clear margin of separation.\n",
    "3. Being effective in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tuning of hyper-parameters since it has a number of hyper-parameters to tune.\n",
    "2. Perfomance issues especially with large data sets because the required training time is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Gaussian Naive Bayes is simple yet powerful model. One real life application of this model is in text classification. See the paper titled: [Naive Bayes for Text Classification with Unbalanced Classes](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~eibe/pubs/FrankAndBouckaertPKDD06new.pdf). Advantages of Gaussain Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity of implementation\n",
    "2. No need for hyper-parameter tuning.\n",
    "3. Good for a dataset with unbalanced classes such as this one i.e., number of students passing is 265 whereas number of students failing is 130.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "In the the context of limited resources, cost and performance, Gaussian Naive Bayes appears to be the best model to use. This true for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It has the lowest training and prediction time compared to Random Forest and Support Vector Machine across all training set sizes.\n",
    "2. Unlike Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, the Gaussian Naive Bayes does not have any significant number of hyper-parameters to tune. In the sklearn implementation, it only has one hyper-parameter, the [priors](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html), which can be set to none in most cases. This further saves time as there is no need to perform GridSearch.\n",
    "3. The average F<sub>1</sub> score of Gaussian Naive Bayes (across all 3 different training sizes) is 0.76. It is better than the average F<sub>1</sub> score of Random Forest but only slightly lower than the average F<sub>1</sub> score of SVM (by 0.02). Since the difference is so marginal, we can sufficiently rely on Gaussian Naive Bayes."

    "Gaussian Naive Bayes is a fairly simple yet highly effective machine learning model. It has shown to do well in its ability to predict which students will pass and which students will fail.

    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",

    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
